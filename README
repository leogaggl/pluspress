PHP script to convert a Google Plus profile to RSS. It uses the Google API Client (https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client) to connect to Google Plus.

This replaces the original script by Michael Mahemoff (https://plus.google.com/106413090159067280619/posts/8NE3cFi4cB6). The main reasons for the change were problems with IFTTT having issues with the initial script.

The RSS output now validates with the W3C Feed Validator (http://validator.w3.org/feed/)
